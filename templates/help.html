                            The <b>LIGYSIS</b> web server is a way to access, visualise, and download the results of our pipeline for the analysis of ligand
                            binding sites, <b>LIGYSIS</b>. The code for the pipeline can be found <a href="https://github.com/JavierSanchez-Utges/ligysis_dev">here</a>.

                            Currently, LIGYSIS only allows for the inspection of proteins that are in our database. Future versions will allow users to submit
                            their own set of protein 3D structures for analysis. These structures should be in PDB format, as well as contain the same protein, and
                            number of copies, i.e., always a dimer, or monomer, or hexamer, etc, bound to the ligands of interest. The pipeline will then be run
                            on the user's structures, and the results will be made available for download. Template Jupyter Notebooks, as well as the code for this
                            pipeline can be found <a href="https://github.com/JavierSanchez-Utges/fragsys_custom">here</a>.
